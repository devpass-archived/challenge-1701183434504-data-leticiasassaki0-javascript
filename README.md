# JavaScript Data Structures Challenge
In this challenge, you are required to implement a class called `Stack` that represents a stack data structure. The `Stack` class should have the following methods:

- `push(element)`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
- `peek()`: Return the top element of the stack without removing it.
- `isEmpty()`: Return true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
- `size()`: Return the number of elements in the stack.

You should also create a test function that validates the correct functionality of the `Stack` class.

## Setup
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your solution.
